# Multi-Blockchain Ontology: A blockchain ontology for Ethereum, Bitcoin, and Hyperledger Fabric.

## Overview

This repository contains an ontology for representing concepts related to Bitcoin, Ethereum and Hyperledger Fabric blockchain frameworks. The ontology is designed to provide a structured framework for defining key concepts, relationships, and properties in the domain of blockchain.

## Ontology Structure

The ontology is organized into several classes and properties that represent various aspects of blockchain technology. Some of the key components include:

- **Block**  
- **Transaction**
- **Ledger State**
- **Fee Model**

## Ontology Evaluation

The objective of ontology evaluation is to determine the accuracy of the identified concepts, properties, and relationships between them. The evaluation methodology involves the evaluation of the ontology using the experts in the domain using a survey questionnaire. The evaluation process engaged both blockchain researchers and developers.
